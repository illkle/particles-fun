# particles-fun

Experimentation with threejs and sharers to make cool particle system. 

I intended to use this as a background for my personal website, but eventually decided against it. Most of the code was written in 2014 in [another repo dev branch](https://github.com/illkle/illkle.com/commits/dev/).
